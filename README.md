## Introduction
Emotion recognition from facial expressions is a crucial task in computer vision with potential applications in a variety of fields, including human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing. In this project,shows a deep learning-based approach to detect emotions from images, and conducted a comparative study of several state-of-the-art models.Additionally used a  publicly available datasets to train and evaluate the models. This project provides insights into the design of deeplearning-based model for emotion recognition and suggests potential avenues for future research.

## Methodology
In the proposed system it uses a approach of the analysis of video segments using Neural Networks which involves extracting visual information in the form of feature vectors. 
In this project,  propose a deep learning-based approach to detect emotions from images captured by surveillance cameras in a supermarket. 
This approach involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a large dataset of annotated facial images to recognize seven basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, neutral and fearful). 
Then apply the trained model to real-time video streams to detect and classify emotions of customers in the supermarket.
The result is stored in the **output** file which is then can be used for data analysis purpose to derive a retail insight.
