## Introduction
Emotion recognition from facial expressions is a crucial task in computer vision with potential applications in a variety of fields, including human-computer interaction, psychology, and marketing. In this project,shows a deep learning-based approach to detect emotions from images, and conducted a comparative study of several state-of-the-art models.Additionally used a  publicly available datasets to train and evaluate the models. This project provides insights into the design of deeplearning-based model for emotion recognition and suggests potential avenues for future research.
